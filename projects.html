                        <h4>Predicting Shipping Address Completeness</h4>
                        <p>Data Scientist @ Razorpay (Jul 2019 - Present)</p>
                        <p><a href="https://razorpay.com/blog/detect-fraud-using-ml-ai-thirdwatch/">[BLOG]</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/razorpay-thirdwatch_do-you-know-about-the-address-situation-in-activity-6718867069552730112-R2Bl">[NEWS]</a> </p>
                    </header>
                    <p>During my time as a Data Scientist at Razorpay, I have worked on several challenging projects, one of these being the following. We are currently working on writing a <strong>research paper</strong> about this.</p>
                    <p>Shipping Addresses in India pose a significant problem to e-commerce companies given that there is no fixed format in which customers provide these addresses and failed delivery attempts on incomplete addresses end up costing the companies a lot of money. Many addresses lack proper order and area hierarchy, refer existing places by different names, feature spelling mistakes and provide wrong information such as zipcode, city name, etc. We use machine learning algorithms for predicting if a given shipping address is detailed enough for successful delivery of orders. This project involves organizing large scale location data in a meaningful way, experimenting with feature and text based prediction algorithms, automatic model building, interpreting ML models and deploying models for production.</p>

                        <h4>Drug Target Interaction Prediction Using Graph Convolutional Networks</h4>
                        <p>Research Intern @ Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (Jul 2018 - Dec 2018)</p>
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/VedangW/dti-gc-mc">[code]</a></p>
                    </header>
                    <p>I worked on this project as part of my undergraduate thesis under the guidance of <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asckkwoh/">Assoc. Prof. Kwoh Chee Keong</a>. Prediction of drug-target interaction involves predicting if a given drug and target protein pair will interact, and is a milestone in the process of drug discovery. Machine Learning approaches used so far include algorithms such as SVMs, Random Forest, Singular Value Decomposition, Random Walk, etc. Since the data can be represented as an interaction matrix between drugs and target proteins, we can extend some matrix completion algorithms to this problem as well, such as those used for collaborative filtering. We used three approaches based on Graph ConvNets - Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion, Seperable Recurrent Multi-Graph Convolutional Neural Network (sRMGCNN) and Variational Graph Auto-Encoders for this problem. These models performed better than traditional ML models both in terms of metrics and training time.</p>
                    <p>Following this project I also worked on a review of Graph Convolutional Networks under the guidance of <a href="bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/basabdattab/profile">Assoc. Prof. Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya</a>. Both these projects combined have resulted in preprints of two research papers and one poster presentation.</p>

                        <h4>Ground Motion Classification</h4>
                        <p>Research Intern @ Institute of Seismological Research, Gandhinagar (May 2017 - Jul 2017, Dec 2017)</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>As part of my internship at the Institute of Seismological Research, a unique institute which focuses only on studying earthquakes, I worked on detecting if the origin of a ground motion signal was an earthquake or blasting activity. The project involved using signal processing libraries in Python such as SciPy and ObsPy to process and transform signal data, creating features from them and using different ML models for experiments. We used feature-based ML algorithms for our experiments, given that both kinds of signals have characteristic properties which can be captured with some computation.</p>

                        <h4>Devanagari Optical Character Recognition</h4>
                        <p>Undergrad student @ BITS Pilani, Goa Campus (Sep 2017 - Dec 2017)</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>I worked on this project as part of the Machine Learning course at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus, instructed by <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin/profile">Prof. Ashwin Srinivasan</a>. The challenge was to convert handwritten characters in the Sanskrit language in a photograph of a manuscript to text. I modelled the problem as multi-class classification and built a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) classifier for prediction. The dataset was collected and labelled manually by the students in the course and hence I also worked on image processing and cleaning using OpenCV.</p>

                    <p>Other projects that I have contributed to include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Activity Detection</strong> <a href="https://github.com/VedangW/Activity-Detection">[CODE]</a>: Predict the activity being performed in a video, given a dataset of similar videos for training. This project was part of the Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic course that I took during my undergraduate program at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transport Scheduler</strong> <a herf="https://github.com/prasadtalasila/TransportScheduler">[CODE]</a>: Build an interactive journey planner service, with timetables from public transit operators. I worked on building this service using message passing between the nodes (stations). This was part of a design oriented project under the guidance of <a href="http://prasad.talasila.in/about/">Dr. Prasad Talasila</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Motion Detection Using WiFi Signals</strong>: This was part of a research project with <a href="https://und.edu/directory/s.vidhyadharan#areas-of-interest">Dr. Sreejith V</a>. We worked on detecting the pattern of motion by capturing WiFi signals between a sender and receiver (of signals).</li>
